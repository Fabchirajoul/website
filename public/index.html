                    <p>
                        <b>International pet travel</b> is vastly different to human travel. There are country
                        regulations,
                        airline stipulations, and veterinary requirements that have to be considered and adhered to
                        before
                        travel arrangements can be made for your pets. <br><br>

                        Global Cargo Logistics will provide you with professional and up-to-date international pet
                        transport
                        guidance and expertise concerning your destination country’s specific requirements and your
                        pet’s veterinary preparations. We will happily shoulder all the anxieties you may have to
                        safely and ethically reunite your family in your new home. <br>

                    <p class="why_us">We would strongly recommend, that the very first thing you do is to acquaint
                        yourself with these few important points:</p>

                    </p>
                    <p><img src="images/icon.JPG">
                        Understand your pet’s travel requirements with your consultant’s guidance.</p>

                    <p class="why_us"> You do better when you know better…. Read the below points to Know Better.</p>

                    <h5>Understanding your international pet travel quotation.</h5>

                    <p>Overseas pet travel and animal relocation is often far more expensive than human travel.</p>
                    <p>Airfreight is calculated on how much space your pet’s travel crate occupies in the airline’s
                        cargo hold. Unfortunately, these prices are never discounted by the airlines. Veterinary fees,
                        airline fuel fees, administration fees, crate charges, and additional customs or state vet
                        endorsements have to be taken into consideration.

                    </p>
                    <p>We will tailor your quote to suit your needs and requirements. However, if you find that the
                        quote is above your budget please let us know, and perhaps we can advise you on how to reduce
                        costs

                    </p>

                    <p class="why_us">Working with a vet.</p>
                    <p>Indicated below are a few mistakes that vets can make. Please, if you are working with your vet
                        make sure he/she is aware of the following:

                    </p>
                    <p><img src="images/icon.JPG">Microchips cannot be inserted after the rabies vaccination, unless it

                        not require an import permit.

                        <br><br>So, if your destination country requires an import permit please see the notes below:
                    </p>
                    <p><img src="images/icon.JPG">Import permits have to be obtained from the country of destination.
                    </p>
                    <p><img src="images/icon.JPG">
                        Import permits need to be applied for far in advance of your pets’ date of departure. It can
                        take several weeks to obtain the permit. It depends on the issuing country..</p>
                    <p><img src="images/icon.JPG">Every import permit is valid for a certain period of time. This means
                        that your pet will have to travel before the expiry date on the permit.</p>
                    <p><img src="images/icon.JPG">Every import permit will specify the countries requirements. Read
                        those requirements. This is very important! You have to comply with the countries requirements
                        before your pet’s can travel.</p>
                    <p><img src="images/icon.JPG">Import permits are valid for one assignment only. This means that
                        every time your pet travels you need to obtain a new import permit from the country of
                        destination.</p>
                    <p><img src="images/icon.JPG">
                        Sometimes cats and dogs have to travel on separate permits and health certificates.</p>
                    <p><img src="images/icon.JPG">Generally pets can travel on a copy of the permit as long as the
                        original permit is submitted upon the pet’s arrival.</p>

                        snack or treat is more suitable. This is because they will be in their travel crate for an
                        extended period and will need to relieve themselves at some point. The larger the meal the
                        greater the chance that your pet will soil their travel crate, this could lead to a very messy
                        dog and travel crate. Alternatively your pet may feel constipated and if they have been fed a
                        large meal this could lead to some discomfort. So please feed them well the night before
                        collection and give your dog a long walk to have enough time for a toilet break before our

                    <p>
                        We would like to make you aware that pet travel is vastly different to human travel. Importing
                        pets into certain cuntries can be a very tricky process, therefore it is important that you
                        follow
                        the guidelines provided by your dedicated pet travel consultant very carefully. <br>

                        We primarily assist with importation of dogs, cats & birds but we can assist you with the
                        importation of other family favourite animals too. Should you have a different type of pet,
                        please contact us in order for us to find out if they are allowed to be imported into South
                        Africa.<br>

                        <p>
                            In 1983, Global Cargo Logistics was established with the purpose of providing a low-cost
                            courier service between Napier and Hastings in New Zealand. A year later, Fastway became the
                            first-ever transport company to enter the franchising arena.
                        </p>
                        <p>In 1993 it was decided to export the business concept to Australia, following a year of
                            research which showed that the same niche market the company had ridden to success in New
                            Zealand, also existed across the Tasman.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                            After commencing operations in Australia in 1993, Global Cargo Logistics enjoyed phenomenal
                            growth and was announced as the country’s fastest-growing private company in 1998 by BRW
                            Magazine with the growth of 14,557% for the previous five years. The success of Fastway in
                            Australia was immediate, and the upwards growth trend continues to this day. </p>
                        <p>Global Cargo Logistics later embarked on an expansion program, offering a National Master
                            Franchise to suitable candidates, to operate the Fastway business for an entire country.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                            GLobal Cargo Logistics commenced operation in South Africa in 2008 and now has 15 regional
                            franchises across the country.</p>

                        <p>In 2011, the Global Cargo Logistics brand began a major revitalisation; an exciting change to
                            the way we look and a renewed focus on our valued customers. Underpinning that is our key
                            value system of delighting the customer at every point in the parcel’s journey. And in 2014
                            Fastway completed the brand refresh in South Africa.</p> <br>

                        <p>Our new look is designed to reflect our growth, progression and of course, our overwhelming
                            ambition to be one of the leading courier companies in operation today.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Today, we’re proud to be able to offer a low cost, quality courier service to customers,
                            large and small across South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and Northern Ireland.

                            and of the highest quality on arrival.</p>
                        <p>We’ve been using your company for a few months now and we are very satisfied with the great
                            friendly service. It doesn’t matter when I call in to get a pickup I always get a friendly
                            voice and they always at least act as they know me and welcome my call.</p>
                        <p>We really appreciate the wonderful service you have given our company.</p>

                        <p>Phillip is like a family member, he even greets and waves when we run into each other at
                            other places in Northcliff. He delivers to another lady in my street too and he is always
                            friendly and happy. He is clearly very proud of his work and the company he works for. He
                            makes a plan to leave my parcel with next door neighbours when I am not at home, or he
                            phones and confirms what time I will be home. He takes ownership of every parcel and ensures
                            a perfect delivery every time! I go running/walking two times a week with a group of
                            friends, and sometimes Phillip crosses our path. He will stop and confirm at what time I
                            will be home to deliver the parcel.</p>
                        <p>We’ve been using your company for a few months now and we are very satisfied with the great

                                We know how important it is that your parcel arrives safely and undamaged.<br><br>
                                1. Choose a good quality box<br>A double walled box, especially for deliveries that
                                contain fragile items, secured appropriately is best.
                                <br><br>
                                2. Choose the right sized box<br>
                                Boxes that are too small could mean the contents get lost. Boxes that are too large are
                                likely to collapse
                                if another parcel is placed on top of it during delivery.
                                <br><br>3. Protect your items<br>
                                Bubble wrap, packing peanuts, foam, and newspaper can all be used to protect your items.
                                <br><br>4. Wrap each item in the box individually<br>
                                When sending multiple items within one box it’s recommended that each item is wrapped
                                individually.
                                This offers better protection for your items and reduces movement.
                                <br><br>5. Seal the parcel with packing tape<br>Seal all open edges of the parcel with
                                wide parcel tape on both the top and bottom of your package to ensure it doesn’t open
                                during transit.

                                <br><br>6. Labelling your parcel<br>Always use clear, accurate address labels on your
                                parcels.

                        <p>Global Cargo Logisitcs provides Metropolitan, Regional and National freight distribution,
                            with twice-daily local
                            services in all key regional and metropolitan locations across all our branches.
                            We use the hub and spoke model of delivery – a system that ensures that our customers
                            are provided with the highest level of service at an economical price.
                            Each Courier Franchisee operates within its own territory, picking up
                            and delivering parcels exclusively within that area. At pre-determined times
                            during the day, all Courier Franchisees return to a secure Regional Franchise
                            depot or hub, to sort and exchange freight. Depots in different cities are linked
                            by overnight road linehaul services.</p>

                            Linehaul cages are used to facilitate transportation and security of freight

                            requirements. Selected hubs throughout the network are used as pick-up
                            and drop-off points to facilitate the efficient distribution of caged freight between
                            Regional Franchises. On all routes, trucks operate on fixed schedules, leaving the
                            originating
                            depot in the evening to arrive at their overnight and or 48hr destinations early in
                            the morning. This ensures that overnight freight is delivered in the morning delivery cycle
