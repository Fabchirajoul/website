                        <p>	
                            In 1983, Global Cargo Logistics was established with the purpose of providing a low-cost courier service between Napier and Hastings in New Zealand. A year later, Fastway became the first-ever transport company to enter the franchising arena. 
                        </p>
                        <p>In 1993 it was decided to export the business concept to Australia, following a year of research which showed that the same niche market the company had ridden to success in New Zealand, also existed across the Tasman.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>	
                            After commencing operations in Australia in 1993, Global Cargo Logistics enjoyed phenomenal growth and was announced as the country’s fastest-growing private company in 1998 by BRW Magazine with the growth of 14,557% for the previous five years. The success of Fastway in Australia was immediate, and the upwards growth trend continues to this day. </p>
                        <p>Global Cargo Logistics later embarked on an expansion program, offering a National Master Franchise to suitable candidates, to operate the Fastway business for an entire country.</p>
                        <br>

                        <p>	
                            GLobal Cargo Logistics commenced operation in South Africa in 2008 and now has 15 regional franchises across the country.</p>
                            
                            <p>In 2011, the  Global Cargo Logistics brand began a major revitalisation; an exciting change to the way we look and a renewed focus on our valued customers. Underpinning that is our key value system of delighting the customer at every point in the parcel’s journey. And in 2014 Fastway completed the brand refresh in South Africa.</p> <br>

                       <p>Our new look is designed to reflect our growth, progression and of course, our overwhelming ambition to be one of the leading courier companies in operation today.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Today, we’re proud to be able to offer a low cost, quality courier service to customers, large and small across South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>

                        <p>Phillip is like a family member, he even greets and waves when we run into each other at other places in Northcliff. He delivers to another lady in my street too and he is always friendly and happy. He is clearly very proud of his work and the company he works for. He makes a plan to leave my parcel with next door neighbours when I am not at home, or he phones and confirms what time I will be home. He takes ownership of every parcel and ensures a perfect delivery every time! I go running/walking two times a week with a group of friends, and sometimes Phillip crosses our path. He will stop and confirm at what time I will be home to deliver the parcel.</p>

                        <br><br>1. What are dangerous goods?<br>
                        Dangerous goods are goods that are dangerous, flammable, explosive, volatile, offensive or are of a damaging nature in the eyes of the 
                        Global Cargo Logistics Courier Franchisee. Usually, dangerous goods have a dangerous good label or diamond on them.<br><br>

                    <p> <span class="why_us"> Can I use Global Cargo Logistics labels in any location you operate ? </span><span>
                        Yes. Global Cargo Logistics is a franchise system and our label numbers can beused in any locations. 
                        For this reason, labels purchased from one location are transferable between businesses or locations. 
                        Pricing may also vary from region to region.

                        To order more satchels and labels, you just speak to your local courier.
                    </span></p>
                    <p> <span class="why_us"> How do I track my delivery ?</span><span>
                        You can <a x-on:click="openHome('tracking')" href=""> track your</a> parcel on our website by using your label number.
                    </span></p>
                    <p><span class="why_us"> How should I package my item? </span>
                        <span>
                            We know how important it is that your parcel arrives safely and undamaged.<br><br>
                            1. Choose a good quality box<br>A double walled box, especially for deliveries that contain fragile items, secured appropriately is best.
                            <br><br>
                            2. Choose the right sized box<br>
                            Boxes that are too small could mean the contents get lost. Boxes that are too large are likely to collapse 
                            if another parcel is placed on top of it during delivery.
                            <br><br>3. Protect your items<br>
                            Bubble wrap, packing peanuts, foam, and newspaper can all be used to protect your items.
                            <br><br>4. Wrap each item in the box individually<br>
                            When sending multiple items within one box it’s recommended that each item is wrapped individually. 
                            This offers better protection for your items and reduces movement.
                            <br><br>5. Seal the parcel with packing tape<br>Seal all open edges of the parcel with wide parcel tape on both the top and bottom of your package to ensure it doesn’t open during transit.

                            <br><br>6. Labelling your parcel<br>Always use clear, accurate address labels on your parcels.
                    </span></p>
                    <p><span class="why_us">What are your payment methods?  </span><span>

                       Credit Card<br>

                        <p>Global Cargo Logisitcs provides Metropolitan, Regional and National freight distribution, with twice-daily local 
                            services in all key regional and metropolitan locations across all our branches.  
                            We use the hub and spoke model of delivery – a system that ensures that our customers 
                            are provided with the highest level of service at an economical price.  
                            Each Courier Franchisee operates within its own territory, picking up 
                            and delivering parcels exclusively within that area. At pre-determined times 
                            during the day, all Courier Franchisees return to a secure Regional Franchise 
                            depot or hub, to sort and exchange freight. Depots in different cities are linked 
                            by overnight road linehaul services.</p>

                            the designated Regional Franchise as quickly and economically as possible. 
                            Linehaul cages are used to facilitate transportation and security of freight

                            requirements. Selected hubs throughout the network are used as pick-up
                             and drop-off points to facilitate the efficient distribution of caged freight between
                            Regional Franchises. On all routes, trucks operate on fixed schedules, leaving the originating 
                            depot in the evening to arrive at their overnight and or 48hr destinations early in
                            the morning. This ensures that overnight freight is delivered in the morning delivery cycle 
                            by Global Cargo Logisitc's Courier Franchisees.</p>
